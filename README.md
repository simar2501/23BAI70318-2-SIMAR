## 📌 Project Description

This project is a modern, single-page web application built using **React** and **Material UI (MUI)**.  
The main focus of this experiment is to design a **clean, professional, and responsive user interface** using a component-based approach.

The webpage follows real-world UI/UX practices and is inspired by modern developer portfolios and SaaS landing pages.

## 🧪 Working of the Website

- When the website loads, only the **Hero section** (“Hello, I’m Simar”) is visible  
- Navigation buttons allow switching between:
  - About
  - Projects
  - Contact
- On clicking a button:
  - The previous section is hidden
  - The selected section fades in smoothly
- The hero section remains visible at all times

# Overview 

This project is developed as part of **Experiment 2** for the **Full Stack Development** course. The main objective of this experiment was to design and develop a **modern, clean, and professional user interface** using a UI component library and to understand how real-world web applications are structured.

For this experiment, I used **React** as the frontend framework and **Material UI (MUI)** as the UI component library. I started the project by creating a React application using **Vite**, which helped me understand a faster and more efficient project setup compared to traditional methods.

After setting up the project, I focused on creating a proper **folder structure**. The application was divided into multiple components such as **Navbar, Hero, About, Projects, and Contact**. This component-based approach helped in keeping the code clean, modular, and easy to manage. Each section of the website is handled by a separate component, which improves readability and reusability of the code.

The design of the website follows a **professional green and neutral color theme**. Special care was taken to avoid random or flashy colors so that the UI looks clean and suitable for real-world usage. The layout is inspired by modern developer portfolio and landing page designs.

When the website loads, only the **Hero section** is visible to the user. This section contains the introduction (“Hello, I’m Simar”) and acts as the main landing section of the webpage. The About, Projects, and Contact sections are not shown initially. These sections are displayed dynamically based on user interaction.

A **navigation bar** is provided at the top of the page which allows the user to switch between different sections. When a navigation button is clicked, the previously visible section is hidden and the selected section appears with a **smooth fade-in animation**. This improves the overall user experience and makes the transitions feel smooth and professional. The Hero section always remains visible so that the user never loses context of the webpage.

The **Projects section** is designed using a card-based layout with Material UI components. Each project card follows the same design style to maintain consistency. This section demonstrates how reusable UI components can be used to present information in a structured and visually appealing manner.

The website is fully **responsive** and adapts well to different screen sizes. Proper spacing, typography, and alignment have been maintained throughout the application to ensure a clean and readable layout.

Through this experiment, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Creating a React application using Vite  
- Using Material UI components effectively  
- Structuring a React project in a modular way  
- Managing UI state for dynamic content  
- Implementing smooth UI transitions and animations  
- Applying basic UI/UX design principles  

The project is deployed using **Vercel**, following the naming convention provided in the experiment guidelines.

Overall, this experiment helped me understand how modern web interfaces are designed and implemented using React and UI component libraries. It also improved my confidence in building professional-looking frontend applications.

Experiment 2 has been completed successfully.
